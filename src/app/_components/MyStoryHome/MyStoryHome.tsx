            I started my journey as a Frontend Developer at Route IT Training
            Center, focusing on React and Next.js. I built practical projects
            like an e-commerce app, which helped me create reusable components,
            manage state with Context API and Redux, and integrate REST APIs.
            Iâ€™m strong in responsive design using TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and
            Material-UI, and continuously improve my skills independently to
            keep up with the latest technologies.
